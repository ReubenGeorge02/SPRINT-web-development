# Issue No. 9
- Links now open in the same tab
- The bug was because the links had a target = "_blank" attribute, which caused it to open in a new tab
- The google drive link for the video - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IOPnDqioBLd8JONeD6JDCdGvviVZZ_FE/view?usp=sharing

# Issue No. 2
- The navbar has been updated and looks better now.
- The navbar elements are centered now , I added a padding of 15px from the left of the navbar
- Added a border-radius of 10px to the navbar links
- Added a hover pseudoclass to the CSS stylesheet for the navbar links and now the background-color and color properties get reversed when the user hovers over the links in the navbar
- The google drive link for the video:
